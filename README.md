# quirk-s

quirk-s is a add-on development of the open-source quantum simulators Quirk [1] and Quirk-E [2].

Quirk [1] was originally implemented by Craig Gidney (aka Strilanc). 

The simulator was enhanced as Quirk-E [2] by the Empirical Software Engineering Research Team and the QIC Team at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland.

quirk-s makes further extensions on top of Quirk-E

# Features

- **State-o-gram** for state visualization display side by side with histogram.
- **Output of vanishing vectors and copying** is implemented below the state-o-gram.
- **UI Settings** for disabling output analysis at the end of the circuits lane.
- **Deutsch-Josza** added to circuit gallery.
